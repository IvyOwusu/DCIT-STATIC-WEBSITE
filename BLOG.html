        <h1>About This Year</h1>
        <p>In the midst of unprecedented times (sigh), the only predictions we can confidently make are about what we'll be wearing. For 2022, that's a cool lineup of trends that draw on 
        <p>'90s and 2000s fashion, inspired by the spring collections we watched coming down the runways just a few months ago.<br></p>
        <p> Now, with influencers and fashion insiders providing some ways to interpret the looks in our day-to-day, we're ready embrace a new year of dressing, and it's decidedly more, well,<br></p>
        <p>more than it has been in recent memory.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>In response to all our time staying home, living in dressed-down basics (read: sweatpants), and missing the many joyful reasons to get all dolled up, the 2022 dress code is a <br></p>
        <p>maximalist's dream. Sure, there are easy silhouettes to choose from — maxi-length skirts and dresses and wide-leg, baggy pants — but the finishes, accessories, and fabrics are <br></p>
        <p> bolder and brighter, a little skin-baring, and made for showing off, on a Zoom screen or otherwise. Here, get a glimpse of the top eight trends for 2022, and shop your favorite <br></p>
        <p> to put your personal spin on the year's biggest styles.</p>
